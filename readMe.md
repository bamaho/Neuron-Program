This program simulates the behaviour of a simplistic neuronal network formed by 12'500 neurons of which 2'500 are of inhibitory and 10'000 of excitatory nature. Depending on the parameters different versions are generated.

The following arcitecture should be in place:

/build

/scr
	gtest/
	CMakeLists.txt
	neuron.hpp
	neuron.cpp
	

/docs - where the doxygen documentation is created
